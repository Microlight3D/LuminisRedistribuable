Luminis scripting API documentation
=============================================

Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation for Luminis scripting API. This API enables 
Luminis advanced user to automate, optimize and customize their 3D micro-printing process 
using Microlight3D micro-printer.


This documentation contains all API class reference and tutorials to help you use Luminis' Python scripting to it's full potential. A good place to start is the turorial on how to generate :ref:`your first curstom fabrication<tuto_first_custom_fabrication>` using Luminis' scripting.

Technology
----------

Luminis' scripting language is `Python 2.7 <https://docs.python.org/2.7/>`_ interfaced to the Luminis' C# API using `IronPython <https://ironpython.net/documentation/>`_.

Execute a script
----------------

Executing a script is very strait forward: simply open Luminis and click on the "import" button (Ctrl + i), choose a python file and load it. Luminis will automaticaly detect it is a script and try to execute it. If any error occurs during execution a pop-up message will appear describing the error.
